# Docker create-react-app template

## Overview

This is just a plainly generated `create-react-app` template with a `Dockerfile` and a `run.sh`. Nothing else. No bells and whistles or anything.

## Requirements

* This was built using Docker version `17.12.0-ce`, so that would be the safest bet, but it may be backwards compatible to a degree. I never tested it.


## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/johnazre/docker-create-react-app.git

```
